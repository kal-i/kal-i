Hi, I'm John Paul, a recent BS Information Technology graduate who enjoys building things and learning through hands-on experience.

I've worked on both desktop and mobile applications using Flutter (Dart), Java, C#, and SQL (PostgreSQL). Lately, I've been learning clean architecture with Flutter and backend development with Java Spring Boot.

I like solving problems, exploring new technologies, and figuring out how things work
