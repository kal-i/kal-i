Hi, I’m John Paul - though in the digital world, I go by *kali*. I'm an aspiring developer based in Legazpi, Philippines.

During my academic years, I built a few projects, some are full-stack, others are either frontend or backend focused with core technologies like Flutter (Dart), Java, .NET (C#), PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Server. While I'm still figuring out where I thrive most, I enjoy exploring things out of curiosity and my desire to understand how it works. 

Outside of coding, I spend time reflecting on my surroundings, thoughts, and decisions. It’s not the kind of reflection that always ends up in a journal, but one lives in scattered thoughts and quiet moments of pause. It helps me stay grounded and aware of where I am and where I want to be.

Currently, I’m rekindling my knowledge of Java and tapping into unfamiliar territory with Spring Boot.

In most cases, I try to blend my work with minimalism, artistry, and poetry - even though I'm barely good at it.
