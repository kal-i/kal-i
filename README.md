A recent BS Information Technology graduate with modest experience in desktop and mobile development using Flutter (Dart), Java, C#, and SQL.

Lately, I’ve been learning clean architecture with Flutter and backend development with Java Spring Boot. I’m always open to learning and enjoy figuring things out, even when it’s challenging.

I’m currently looking for an opportunity to start my journey as a software developer where I can grow, and contribute to meaningful projects.
